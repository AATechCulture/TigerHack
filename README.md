# Aida by American

## Challenge Statement(s) Addressed 🎯
** How might we revolutionize the boarding process to significantly reduce delays, minimize congestion, and enhance passenger satisfaction while maintaining existing priority boarding groups?

## Project Description 🤯
**Seamless Seat-Based Boarding: Aida assigns boarding numbers based on seat positions, prioritizing back-to-front and window-to-aisle, reducing congestion.
**Real-Time Queue Updates: Get instant alerts on queue lengths at various airport checkpoints, empowering you to plan your journey efficiently.
**Predictive Insights: Leverage historical data and AI algorithms to predict peak times, helping you and American Airlines allocate resources wisely for a smoother travel experience.

## Project Value 💰
Aida by American targets air travelers who crave a stress-free journey, including frequent flyers and business professionals. They seek efficient travel experiences and value their time.
The app offers tangible benefits for customers through reduced waiting times, smoother boarding, and real-time queue updates, ensuring passengers have more control over their travel plans and experience less stress.
Additionally, it translates into significant cost and time savings for American Airlines, improving operational efficiency and reducing delays. E.g 40,000 hours saved per year & $70M Savings (if one minute was saved per flight * 5000 flights * 365 days)
